# Palindrome Checker

A simple static website that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Features
- User-friendly interface with a glowing text effect
- Real-time palindrome checking
- Input validation to ensure a word or phrase is provided
- Animated background and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the page
- **CSS**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: Palindrome checking logic and event handling

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Equirizon/palindrome-checker.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a word or phrase in the input field.
4. Click the "Check" button to see the result.

## File Structure
```
project-folder/
│── index.html    # Main HTML file
│── script.js     # JavaScript logic
│── styles.css    # Styling and animations
│── assets/       # Folder for images and icons
```

## How It Works
1. The user enters a word or phrase.
2. JavaScript removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts the input to lowercase.
3. The cleaned string is reversed and compared to the original.
4. The result is displayed, indicating whether the input is a palindrome.
